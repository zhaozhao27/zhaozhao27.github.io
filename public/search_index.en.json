They are updated alongside Duckquill to ensure that you don‚Äôt need to manually update them every release.\nTo enable these mods, you need to paste provided Sass to [appropriate file], e.g sass/mods.scss under your website, then enable it in config.toml:\n\n\nBackground Image\nWant to set some nice image as a background? We got you covered:\n\n\nMost of the time contrast should be okay, but what if it‚Äôs not? Simply adjust the opacity of --bg-overlay based on your needs:\n\n\nClassic Article List\nPrefer the less fancy look of the article list used in Duckquill some time ago (to some extent)? It can be done with the classic-article-list mod:\n\n\n\nClassic Navbar\nYou can make navbar have more traditional look by using the classic-nav mod:\n\n\nOr you can make it sticked to top but not full-width with the sticked-nav mod:\n\n\t\n\t\tNote\n\tNot compatible with the classic-nav mod.\n\n\n\n\n\nClassic Strikethrough\nThe default strikethrough style is too much? It can be fixed using the classic-del mod:\n\n\n\nModern Headings\nDefault headings might not fit your taste, that‚Äôs understandable. They can be made boring fixed with the modern-headings mod:\n\n\n\nModern Horizontal Rule\nDon‚Äôt like that fancy horizontal rule? Make it more modern with the modern-hr mod:\n\n\n\nNo Edge Highlight\nHate the skeuomorphic edge highlight on all semi-transparent elements?

They can be used on all pages.\n\nAlerts\nGitHub-style alerts. Simply wrap the text of desired alert inside the shortcode to get the desired look.\nAvailable alert types:\n\nnote: Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.\ntip: Helpful advice for doing things better or more easily.\nimportant: Key information users need to know to achieve their goal.\nwarning: Urgent info that needs immediate user attention to avoid problems.\ncaution: Advises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tNote\n\tUseful information that users should know, even when skimming content.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tTip\n\tHelpful advice for doing things better or more easily.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tImportant\n\tKey information users need to know to achieve their goal.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWarning\n\tUrgent info that needs immediate user attention to avoid problems.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tCaution\n\tAdvises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions.\n\n\n\nImages and Videos\nBy default images and videos come with some generic styling, such as rounded corners and shadow. To fine-tune these, you can use shortcodes with different variable combinations.\nAvailable variables are:\n\nurl: URL to an image.\nurl_min: URL to compressed version of an image, original can be opened by clicking on the image.\nalt: Alt text, same as if the text were inside square brackets in Markdown.\nfull: Forces image to be full-width.\nfull_bleed: Forces image to fill all the available screen width. Removes shadow, rounded corners and zoom on hover.\nstart: Float image to the start of paragraph and scale it down.\nend: Float image to the end of paragraph and scale it down.\npixels: Uses nearest neighbor algorithm for scaling, useful for keeping pixel-art sharp.\ntransparent: Removes rounded corners and shadow, useful for images with transparency.\nno_hover: Removes zoom on hover.\nspoiler: Blurs image until hovered over/pressed on, useful for plot rich game screenshots.\nspoiler with solid: Ditto, but makes the image completely hidden.\n\n\n\n\nImage with an alt text and without zoom on hover\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\nImage with compressed version, an alt text, and without zoom on hover\n\n\n\nImage with an alt text, hidden behind a spoiler\n\nAlternatively, you can append the following URL anchors. It can be more handy in some cases, e.g. such images will render normally in any Markdown editor, opposed to the Zola shortcodes.\n\n#full: Forces image to be full-width.\n#full-bleed: Forces image to fill all the available screen width. Removes shadow, rounded corners and zoom on hover.\n#start: Float image to the start of paragraph and scale it down.\n#end: Float image to the end of paragraph and scale it down.\n#pixels: Uses nearest neighbor algorithm for scaling, useful for keeping pixel-art sharp.\n#transparent: Removes rounded corners and shadow, useful for images with transparency.\n#no-hover: Removes zoom on hover.\n#spoiler: Blurs image until hovered over/pressed on, useful for plot rich game screenshots.\n#spoiler with #solid: Ditto, but makes the image completely hidden.\n\n\n\n\nFull-width image with an alt text, pixel-art rendering, no shadow and rounded corners, and no zoom on hover\n\n\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem.

Quills were used for writing with ink before the invention of the dip pen, the metal-nibbed pen, the fountain pen, and, eventually, the ballpoint pen.\nAs with the earlier reed pen (and later dip pen), a quill has no internal ink reservoir and therefore needs to periodically be dipped into an inkwell during writing. The hand-cut goose quill is rarely used as a calligraphy tool anymore because many papers are now derived from wood pulp and would quickly wear a quill down. However it is still the tool of choice for a few scribes who have noted that quills provide an unmatched sharp stroke as well as greater flexibility than a steel pen.\n\nKeyboard Input (&lt;kbd&gt;)\n\nTo switch the keyboard layout, press ‚åò Super + Space.\n\nMark Text (&lt;mark&gt;)\n\nYou know what?

Never in all his years at the company had this happened, this complete isolation.\nSomething was very clearly wrong. Shocked, frozen solid, Stanley found himself unable to move for the longest time.\nBut as he came to his wits and regained his senses, he got up from his desk and stepped out of his office.\nAll of his co-workers were gone. What could it mean? Stanley decided to go to the meeting room; perhaps he had simply missed a memo.\n","path":null}]
