If not set regular variant will be used.\nfix_contrast: Whether to fix low contrast in text selection, checkboxes, etc. Use only if the default doesn’t provide enough contrast, e.g. the accent color is set to yellow.\nfix_contrast_dark: Ditto but for the dark theme.\nemoji_favicon: Use emoji as a favicon. Only one emoji is being rendered, everything else is truncated.\nstyles: Additional CSS styles; expects them to be in the ./static/ directory. If you are using Sass it will be generated there automatically.\nscripts: Additional JavaScript scripts; expects them to be in the ./static/ directory.\nkatex: Whether to enable the KaTeX library for rendering LaTeX.\ntoc: Enables table of contents. Only first 2 levels of headings are listed.\ntoc_inline: Whether to render inline table of contents at the top of all pages, in addition to floating quick navigation buttons.\ntoc_ordered: Whether to use numbered (ordered) list for table of contents.\n\nOther variables:\n\napple_touch_icon: Filename of the colocated Apple Touch Icon.\nfavicon: Filename of the colocated favicon.\ncard: Filename of the colocated metadata card.\narchive: Displays an archived message.\ntrigger: Displays a trigger warning message.\ndisclaimer: Displays a disclaimer message.\n\n\nBlog post specific:\n\nbanner: Filename of the colocated banner image. Recommended dimensions are 2:1 aspect ratio and 1920x960 resolution.\nbanner_pixels Makes the banner use nearest neighbor algorithm for scaling, useful for keeping pixel-art sharp.\narchived: Make the post visually stand out in the post list. Also accepts message as a value.\nfeatured: Ditto but doesn’t accept message as a value.\nhot: Ditto.\npoor: Ditto.\n\nIn [extra.comments] section:\n\nhost: The Mastodon server on which the post was posted.\nuser: The username of the poster.\nid: ID of the post; the one in the URL.\n\n\nLocalization\nDuckquill ships with a localization system based on one used in tabi, it’s very easy to use and quite flexible at the same time.\nTo add a translation, simply create a file in your site’s i18n directory called LANG_CODE.toml, e.g fr.toml. The language code should be either ISO 639-1 or BCP 47.\nInside that file, copy-paste one of the existing translations from Duckquill and adapt it to your needs. You can also check tabi translation files for reference.\nAdditionally to translating Duckquill, you can also override the English stings by copy-pasting en.toml from Duckquill to the i18n directory of your website and adjusting the values to your liking.\n\nCustom Styles\nTo add your own or override existing styles, create a custom style and add it in the config.toml:\n\nAdditional styles are expected it to be in the static directory. If you are using Sass they will be compiled there by default.\nIf for some reason overridden style is not respected, try using !important (don’t use it unless needed). You can import styles from Duckquill using:\n\nYou can also load styles per page/section by setting them inside page’s front matter:\n\n\nAccent Color\nDuckquill respects chosen accent color everywhere. To use your own, simply change it in config.toml:\n\nAdditionally, you can set a separate color for dark mode:\n\n\nFavicon\nFiles named favicon.png and apple-touch-icon.png are used as favicon and Apple Touch Icon respectively. For animated favicon you can use APNG with the png file extension.\n\nIn the Wild\n\n  This list is starting to get long, so click on it to expand it.\n\nagustinramirodiaz.github.io\nalavi.me\naparoksha.dev\narfh.pages.dev\nbambalabs.co\nbano.dev\nbenjaminandre.be\nblog.digital-horror.co\nblog.millefeuille42.fr\nblog.pansi21.xyz\nblog.thundernetwork.org\nblog2.maki0419.com\ncabysm.github.io\ndaveparr.info\ndavepoltorak.com\ndrismir.ca\nenriquekesslerm.com\ngregorni.gitlab.io\nharrypotterexplained.com\nhyouteki.github.io\nikergimenez.neocities.org\nkaipeacock.com\nlarrabyte.dev\nluciengheerbrant.com\nlukoktonos.com\nmatteorisso.github.io\nmaxffarrell.com\nmaxime.letemple.fr\nmourelask.xyz\nmuelsyse.codeberg.page\nmukuljoshi.xyz\nnbenedek.me\nnikos-archive.org\nnisf.be\nnullpuppy.github.io\nnutn-isc.gitlab.io\norzklv.uz\npenandink.work\npyter.at\nreallysimple.io\nrerere.unlogic.co.uk\nrossjr.dev\nsamienr.com\nshrimple.srht.site\nsiddharthsabron.in\nsorg.codeberg.page\nsungsphinx.codeberg.page\ntmblog.pages.dev\ntreeniks.github.io\nvegner.io\nvoluxyy.github.io\nwinnydows.com\nzlog.si-on.top\nYours?

The reason for not putting the sources in the same repo as Duckquill itself is simple: I want it to be as small as possible, so that repo cloning is fast and doesn’t make the site significantly heavier; this is also why the demo uses remote images instead of local copies.\n\nCredits\n\nQuill image used in the metadata card\n\n\nTools Used\n\nVSCodium - Free/Libre Open Source Software Binaries of VS Code\n\nCapitalize - Title capitalization without random websites.\nEven Better TOML - For config.toml basically.\nMonokai Pro - Awfully pretty theme.\nPX to REM - Easy conversion from PX to REM and vice versa.\nSCSS IntelliSense - Not sure if it actually works. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\nSort CSS - A lifesaver for long CSS properties.\nTera - Tera template engine (the one Zola uses) support.\n\n\nFirefox developer tools - Best of its kind.\n\nAs for the code formatter I use built-in VSCodium one. Prettier is good but I don’t like how it tries to make code fit in a very narrow column, this can be changed of course, but built-in formatter does it’s job so I don’t bother doing so.\n\nThanks To\n\nJakub Steiner for the OS Component Website, which served as a starting point and inspiration.\nÓscar for tabi and its translation system, rel attributes, and Content Security Policy.\nCarl Schwan for the Mastodon-powered Comments.\nJonathan Neal for the normalize.css.\nGNOME design team for the icon development kit\nModern Font Stacks for the system font stack.\nTheEvilSkeleton for helping to improve the look and accessibility.\nDexter Reed for being the first Duckquill user, preventing it from being axed.\nEveryone who supported me and said good stuff &lt;3\n\n","path":null},{"url":"https://zhaozhao27.github.io/demo/","title":"Demo Page","description":null,"body":"\nMarkdown\nText can be bold, italic, strikethrough, and all at the same time.\nLink to another page.\nThere should be whitespace between paragraphs[1].\n\nHeading 1\n\nHeading 2\n\nHeading 3\n\nHeading 4\n\nHeading 5\n\nHeading 6\nThis is a normal paragraph[2] following a header.\n😭😂🥺🤣❤️✨🙏😍🥰😊\n\n\n“Original content is original only for a few seconds before getting old”\n\nRule #21 of the internet\n\n\n\nItem 1\nItem 2\n\nItem 2.1\nItem 2.2\n\n\nItem 3\nItem 4\n\n\nPerform step #1\nProceed to step #2\nConclude with step #3\n\n\n\nMilk\n\nEggs\n\nFlour\n\nCoffee\n\nCombustible lemons\n\n\nMareRatingAdditional info\nFluttershyBest poneShy and adorable\nApple JackGood poneHonest and nice\nPinkie PieFun poneParties and ADHD\nTwilightMain poneNeeerd\nRainbow DashYesLooks badass\nRarityFancy poneGenerous\nDerpy HoovesM u f f i n s[REDACTED]\n\n\n\n\n\nExtra\n\nKaTeX\nDuckquill can render LaTeX using the KaTeX library.

Removes shadow, rounded corners and zoom on hover.\nstart: Float image to the start of paragraph and scale it down.\nend: Float image to the end of paragraph and scale it down.\npixels: Uses nearest neighbor algorithm for scaling, useful for keeping pixel-art sharp.\ntransparent: Removes rounded corners and shadow, useful for images with transparency.\nno_hover: Removes zoom on hover.\nspoiler: Blurs image until hovered over/pressed on, useful for plot rich game screenshots.\nspoiler with solid: Ditto, but makes the image completely hidden.\n\n\n\n\nImage with an alt text and without zoom on hover\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\nImage with compressed version, an alt text, and without zoom on hover\n\n\n\nImage with an alt text, hidden behind a spoiler\n\nAlternatively, you can append the following URL anchors.

Quills were used for writing with ink before the invention of the dip pen, the metal-nibbed pen, the fountain pen, and, eventually, the ballpoint pen.\nAs with the earlier reed pen (and later dip pen), a quill has no internal ink reservoir and therefore needs to periodically be dipped into an inkwell during writing. The hand-cut goose quill is rarely used as a calligraphy tool anymore because many papers are now derived from wood pulp and would quickly wear a quill down. However it is still the tool of choice for a few scribes who have noted that quills provide an unmatched sharp stroke as well as greater flexibility than a steel pen.\n\nKeyboard Input (&lt;kbd&gt;)\n\nTo switch the keyboard layout, press ⌘ Super + Space.\n\nMark Text (&lt;mark&gt;)\n\nYou know what?
